## P-hacking to its finest

This is a project to demonstrate how different handling and processes could lead to p-hacking or other misinterpretations of statistical results.

You will find the dataset used in the Original-data file as well as a description of its content.

To have more information concerning the computer requirements, the preprocessing and the analysis, please visit the Command file directory.

Under the Documents file, you will find plots and results acquired after running the script under the Command file.

Have fun :)
